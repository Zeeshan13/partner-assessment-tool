# Partner Assessment Tool

## Relationship Pattern Assessment: Confidential Insights and Character Analysis

### Project Overview

The **Partner Assessment Tool** project was developed to address the need for accessible, confidential relationship guidance in an increasingly complex social landscape. Utilizing psychological assessment principles and character-driven insights, this full-stack web application provides users with personalized relationship evaluations while maintaining complete anonymity and privacy.

### What We Did

- **Full-Stack Development**: Built a comprehensive web application using React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend, demonstrating proficiency in modern JavaScript development across the entire technology stack.

- **User Experience Design**: Created an intuitive, multi-stage assessment flow that guides users through demographics collection, relationship evaluation questions, and personalized results delivery, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Integrated Large Language Models (OpenAI GPT and Claude) to generate personalized, nuanced relationship insights based on user responses, creating dynamic and contextually relevant assessment results that go beyond static templates.

- **Character-Based Results System**: Implemented a sophisticated results generation engine that delivers insights through relatable character personas, making complex relationship dynamics more accessible and actionable for users.

- **LLM Integration**: Leveraged advanced AI models to analyze response patterns and generate tailored recommendations, demonstrating proficiency in working with modern AI APIs and prompt engineering for psychological assessment applications.

- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Developed a session-based system that processes assessments without storing personal data, ensuring complete user anonymity while maintaining functionality through temporary session management.

- **Responsive Web Design**: Engineered a mobile-first, responsive interface that provides consistent functionality across all devices, from smartphones to desktop computers.

### Final Product
